# spacy tutorial
This is a basic spacy tutorial introducing NER and custom components. It also has a project about detecting text. We extract a website which is about a financial report, and our goal is to detect all the companies and stocks inside the website. This refers to NER recogonization and we need to make customed pipelines to fit in this case.
