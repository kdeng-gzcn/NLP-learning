## Resume project
- This an NLP project about resume detecting.
- We are using Tfidf for transformation in model training which is for job recommendation and role classification, and use regex repression for resume parsing and text extraction.

## Spacy tutorial
- This is a basic spacy tutorial introducing NER and custom components.
- It also has a project about detecting text. We extract a website which is about a financial report, and our goal is to detect all the companies and stocks inside the website.
- This refers to NER recogonization and we need to make customed pipelines to fit in this case.
